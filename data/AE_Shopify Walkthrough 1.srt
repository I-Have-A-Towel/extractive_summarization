97
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:28,895
we'd

98
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:29,015
be

99
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:29,405

my

108
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:33,185
thought

109
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:33,365
is

110
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:33,755
just

111
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:34,205

116
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:36,605
where,

117
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:37,265
uh,

118
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:37,504
we

119
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:37,685
have

120
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:37,835

123
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:38,615
So

124
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:38,855
like

125
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:39,004

00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:18,375
Um,

251
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:19,665

273
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:26,675
And

274
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:26,945

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,250
So,

433
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:14,730
uh,

434
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:14,880
the

435
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,270
example

436
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,330
I

437
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:15,660
have

438
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:15,870
is

439
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,200
this

440
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,620
a

441
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,160
monogram

442
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,580
coffee

443
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:17,910
ad

444
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,060
for

445
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,480
this,

446
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,560
uh,

447
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,190
bag

448
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,310
of

449
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,940
coffee.

450
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,210
There's

451
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,420
two

452
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,110
images.

453
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:22,590
And,

454
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,100
um,

455
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,050
I'll

456
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,230
just

457
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,530
play

458
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:25,830
through

459
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,130
what

460
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,310
the

461
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:26,490
kind

462
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:26,550
of

463
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,120
export

464
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,390
might

465
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,630
look

466
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,110
like

467
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,720
first.

468
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:31,760
And

469
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,000
again,

470
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,240
really

471
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,960
simple,

472
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,410
but

473
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:33,680
just

474
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,950
these

475
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,280
are.

476
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:35,250
Would

477
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,430
be

478
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,910
entirely

479
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,540
dynamic

480
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:36,690
and

481
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,109
possibly

482
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:37,920
randomized,

483
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,370
uh,

484
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,090
things.

485
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,019
And

486
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:45,170
so

487
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,380
that's

488
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,500
like

489
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:45,560
a

490
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:45,950
super

491
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,310
simple

492
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:46,609
ad

493
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:46,910
template

494
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,090
right

495
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,390
there.

496
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:47,690
You

497
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:47,990
pipe

498
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,260
that

499
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,859
through,

500
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,820
uh,

501
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,359
the

502
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:50,600
four

503
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,750
by

504
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,109
five

505
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:51,230
as

506
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,890
well.

507
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,220
So

508
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,310
you

509
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,670
can

510
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:52,940
do

511
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,030
the

512
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,269
same

513
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:53,720
stuff

514
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:53,900
and

515
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,019
we

516
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:54,290
can

517
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,769
modify

518
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:55,100
this

519
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,280
as

520
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,519
well.

521
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:55,850
Just,

522
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:56,450
you

523
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:56,540
know,

524
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:56,810
all

525
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,290
formatted

526
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:57,440
for

527
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,890
square.

528
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,040
So

529
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,459
basically

530
00:02:58,459 --> 00:02:58,549
you

531
00:02:58,549 --> 00:02:58,940
can,

532
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,500
uh,

533
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,010
crop

534
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,160
it

535
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,609
down

536
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:01,940
as

537
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,060
you

538
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,299
need

539
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:02,570
it.

540
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:03,680
Um,

541
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:05,355
Again,

542
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:05,625
very

543
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,105
simple.

544
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:06,464
Uh,

545
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:06,734
so

546
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:06,855
the

547
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:07,065
way

548
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:07,154
that

549
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:07,304
this

550
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:07,424
is

551
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:07,934
structured

552
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:08,355
Breton

553
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:09,315
is

554
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:09,524
we

555
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,035
have

556
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:10,424
a

557
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:10,875
couple,

558
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:11,875
basically

559
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:11,994
you

560
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:12,225
like

561
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:12,554
fill

562
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:12,644
it

563
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:12,825
up

564
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,005
from

565
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:13,095
the

566
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:13,484
ground

567
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:13,665
up

568
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:13,845
and

569
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:13,934
you

570
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:14,084
have

571
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:14,204
all

572
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:14,355
these

573
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:14,535
things

574
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:14,625
to

575
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:14,894
work

576
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,135
from.

577
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:15,494
So

578
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:15,885
in

579
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:15,975
our

581
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:16,635
we

582
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:16,815
can

583
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:17,084
take

584
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:17,265
like

585
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:17,325
a

00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:17,744

a

591
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:19,695

593
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:20,954

594
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:20,984
a

595
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:21,404

596
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:21,734
asset.

597
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:21,825
And

598
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:21,975
those

599
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:22,065
have

600
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:22,334
different

601
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,084
characteristics.

602
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:23,174
You

603
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:23,295
can

604
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:23,744
change

You

613
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:26,234
know,

614
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:26,415

For

619
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:28,394
you

620
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:28,695
swap

621
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:28,904

So

699
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:58,950
if

700
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,040

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:06,750
work

1071
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:06,870
at

1072
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,020
this

1073
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,260
point.

1074
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,320
I

1075
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,470
don't

1076
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:07,590
have

1077
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,760
any

1078
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:07,860
the

1079
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,220
script

1080
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,430
built

1081
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,670
out,

1082
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:08,880
but

1083
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,150
because

1084
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,210
I

1085
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,540
have,

1086
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm

1087
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,380
scraping

1088
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,440
a

1089
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:10,560
lot

1090
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:10,620
of

1091
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:10,740
that

1092
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:10,950
data

1093
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,370
already.

1094
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:11,460
I

1095
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:11,730
don't

1096
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,270
imagine

1097
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,390
the

1098
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,750
script

1099
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:12,810
to

1100
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:12,930
be

1101
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,170
too

1102
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,560
hard.

1103
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:13,710
It's

1104
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,070
just.

1105
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:15,015
Kind

1106
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:15,135
of

1107
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:15,854
pulling,

1108
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:16,155
it's

1109
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:16,275
like

1110
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:16,784
replacing

1111
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:16,844
a

1112
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:17,205
source

1113
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:17,594
asset

1114
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:18,284
somewhere,

1115
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:19,604
cloning

1116
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:20,055
that,

1117
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:20,474
uh,

1118
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:21,255
composition

1119
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:21,405
and

1120
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:21,525
then

1121
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:21,794
like

1122
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:22,335
dropping

1123
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:22,424
it

1124
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:22,575
through

1125
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:22,844
this

1126
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:23,085
and

1127
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:23,505
linking

1128
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:23,745
stuff

1129
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:23,895
up.

1130
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:24,135
I

1131
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:24,465
don't

1132
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:24,645
think

1133
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:24,794
that

1134
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:24,974
should

1135
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:25,065
be

1136
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:25,305
too

1137
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:25,635
hard

1138
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:25,695
of

1139
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:25,755
a

1140
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:26,025
script

1141
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:26,115
to

1142
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:26,445
write.

1143
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:27,375
And,

1144
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:27,885
uh,

1145
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:28,844
it,

1146
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:29,115
as

1147
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:29,265
far

1148
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:29,385
as

1149
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:29,445
a,

1150
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:29,895
pre-build

1151
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:30,015
like

1152
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:30,164
as

1153
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:30,315
far

1154
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:30,435
as

1155
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:30,555
how

1156
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:30,734
long

1157
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:30,825
it

1158
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:30,945
will

1159
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:31,395
take,

1160
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:31,995
uh,

1161
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:32,145
I

1162
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:32,534
really

1163
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:32,955
expect

1164
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:33,164
that

1165
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:33,284
to

1166
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:33,405
be

1167
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:33,435
a

1168
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:33,765
pretty

1169
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:34,635
quick

1170
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,085
extend

1171
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:35,354
script

1172
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:36,044
script.

1173
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:36,615
Um,

1174
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:37,515
