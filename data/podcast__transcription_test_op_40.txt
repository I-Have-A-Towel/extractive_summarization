00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:02:01,455-->00:02:03,945-->You build a deodorant brand of all things
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:06:08,594-->00:06:13,635-->I really liked what it stood for, which was like, we want to use ingredients that were like native to the earth
00:10:14,324-->00:10:16,454-->And I was just like, look, these products, aren't cutting it
00:10:42,605-->00:10:46,925-->I get a bunch of crinkle paper delivered to the house with wonderful is my brother is the messiest
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:12:18,690-->00:12:21,030-->She'd be like, go quit this business tomorrow
00:12:59,500-->00:13:02,290-->Do you still get hands-on with the Facebook ads
00:15:02,105-->00:15:07,415-->And the meantime I'm like Googling and I'm like, okay, Who makes deodorants, like I've got a formula I want to make
00:18:10,385-->00:18:18,455-->And so like, you know, we launched like, you know, in July, 2015, we were doing a couple hundred dollars in revenue a month by January, 2016
00:20:50,370-->00:20:53,250-->And so, you know, look what had been happening is that okay
00:21:42,520-->00:21:44,590-->Solomon's like, you're running the washer and dryer every day
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:23:50,370-->00:23:52,320-->I don't know what quality control looks like over there
00:23:56,710-->00:23:58,000-->We didn't want any of that kind of stuff
00:25:22,960-->00:25:26,050-->If you buy directly from us, we were following up with every customer
00:27:12,370-->00:27:14,229-->We're getting into the weeds as much as possible
00:29:12,500-->00:29:18,470-->Just me at the company I'm doing with customer service have a really good idea of what the problems are at the company doing the operation
00:30:23,225-->00:30:25,865-->Was it, you know, were you already doing well financially
00:36:02,015-->00:36:06,755-->Sir, we hired another person, a third, uh, the third person to join the team and he's doing customer service
00:37:01,130-->00:37:04,120-->Business to grow from that a hundred K a month to a million a month
00:37:30,180-->00:37:33,030-->We're spending more on ads because we understand product market fit
00:39:22,029-->00:39:24,189-->Otherwise we're going to lose money on every single order
00:40:34,790-->00:40:37,640-->And we're just like, I think this is a product that people want and need
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:50:54,880-->00:50:58,570-->You know, they're just like, uh, so, so you're up at 2:00 AM preparing these things for them
00:52:19,445-->00:52:22,805-->But in reality, we had a trademark issue until we sold the business
00:53:58,775-->00:54:00,995-->These guys are not going to go away unless we do this
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:56:46,330-->00:56:48,910-->You come after Ross, we're building this wall 10 feet higher
00:56:54,779-->00:56:58,790-->Like competitiveness with him or I think it came from him
00:57:25,820-->00:57:31,640-->So one, I think one of the issues with these types of companies is always about like, or w what the deal is like deal certainty
00:58:41,745-->00:58:43,694-->And we haven't even been there for 52 weeks
00:59:24,065-->00:59:25,865-->And then you're like, this was a great deodorant
01:01:07,270-->01:01:09,339-->I'm like, I know what's working in my company
01:04:13,085-->01:04:17,515-->And like one of the things I realized afterwards, cause you know, all these people are like, Oh, being ready, which is not that great
01:05:05,950-->01:05:09,920-->Like, you know, we have this contest internally to make another email funny and very human
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:09:38,035-->01:09:39,775-->This, this is what I like to do on the weekends
