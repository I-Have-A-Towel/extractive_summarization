00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:00:12,320-->00:00:17,840-->So why would anyone be interested in investing in a category that only has $30 million a year run rates
00:01:17,265-->00:01:21,645-->And so he sold it two and a half years later to Proctor and gamble for a hundred million dollars
00:01:27,555-->00:01:30,255-->But because he is a very entertaining guy, very charismatic
00:02:22,065-->00:02:25,245-->So where are you when you have the idea for native deodorant
00:02:37,490-->00:02:39,320-->And so I'm really familiar with this place
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:06:20,575-->00:06:22,735-->Cause I don't think that that's necessarily the case
00:06:32,994-->00:06:36,984-->Bought the name in July, 2015, basically 12 days later launched the business
00:07:00,955-->00:07:03,594-->But initially I was like, look, I don't think this business will work out
00:10:04,605-->00:10:06,675-->Um, so does my sister cause she's pregnant
00:10:42,605-->00:10:46,925-->I get a bunch of crinkle paper delivered to the house with wonderful is my brother is the messiest
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:13:34,250-->00:13:39,709-->I used to be selling products at a farmer's market, and now I'm making 500 dealers for you a week
00:13:47,680-->00:13:50,110-->We're both gonna like, hit home runs with this business
00:14:25,655-->00:14:28,085-->And so I'm like, okay, maybe this business is over
00:14:55,355-->00:14:57,695-->And, you know, she's like, okay, that sounds fair and reasonable
00:15:09,775-->00:15:12,025-->Quick break in the action to talk about hustle con
00:16:39,475-->00:16:42,265-->Let me give this to you guys so that you can get a discount
00:16:45,105-->00:16:47,925-->My first million, all caps, all one word again
00:17:56,385-->00:17:58,845-->I'm not going to like, uh, you know, bankrupt the business
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:19:05,740-->00:19:08,830-->Cause that's like a, you know, we're not, we're not doing a ton of sales
00:19:48,649-->00:19:51,170-->Like, you know, we, we moved to a new manufacturer
00:20:53,310-->00:21:01,620-->Over the course of the last eight months since this, or like last four months, since this woman had been making deodorant for me, like we'd gotten a lot of customer feedback basically saying our formula was kind of mediocre
00:21:17,490-->00:21:21,240-->And so for a while, we've been attempting to make a better deodorant, like a better formula
00:21:42,520-->00:21:44,590-->Solomon's like, you're running the washer and dryer every day
00:21:50,879-->00:21:54,985-->Like whenever I listen to a guest, tell the stories, I think to myself, Could I do this business
00:22:27,690-->00:22:30,930-->And in the next six months, I will be an expert on deodorant
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:23:36,450-->00:23:39,330-->It allows us to have a really flexible supply chain two
00:23:53,080-->00:23:55,570-->Great the day I go over there and terrible the next day
00:24:10,060-->00:24:12,850-->And we're going to jump back into the story, but one more tactical piece
00:25:10,580-->00:25:13,070-->So this must have been kind of unusual for people, I guess
00:25:57,935-->00:26:06,065-->That's milled to another particle size and we'll, we'll monitor your reviews six weeks after you purchase and your repeat purchase rates 12 weeks after you purchase and say, you know what
00:26:10,585-->00:26:14,605-->And as a result, it must be that that's the formula that we sent to the Sams of the world are better
00:26:56,635-->00:27:07,419-->But we're doing like tiny changes, like, you know, like changes that wouldn't even influence the ingredient tackle that we're like, Hey look, do you think we should put in, you know, Uh, 1% of this ingredient or 1
00:27:07,419-->00:27:09,189-->05% of this to see what's better
00:27:12,370-->00:27:14,229-->We're getting into the weeds as much as possible
00:27:25,800-->00:27:27,929-->Number two, definitely take it from there
00:27:53,945-->00:27:58,205-->We're either going to close this business or switch formulas, let's switch formulas and see what happens
00:28:15,095-->00:28:20,495-->Like, you know, deodorant's not something you can really go without like, you know, like toothpaste, I need this
00:29:12,500-->00:29:18,470-->Just me at the company I'm doing with customer service have a really good idea of what the problems are at the company doing the operation
00:29:34,870-->00:29:40,840-->Uh, I was not, uh, you know, in Silicon Valley, there's a lot of people that whole thing to do is say, I'm here to change the world
00:33:01,445-->00:33:05,315-->I would want to maximize these sort of earnings per capita in my company
00:33:42,179-->00:33:45,510-->And so we're like, you know, we've got some cash, but not a ton of cash
00:36:15,305-->00:36:18,335-->So we go from a hundred K in like may to a million in November
00:36:56,390-->00:36:59,900-->And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now
00:37:01,130-->00:37:04,120-->Business to grow from that a hundred K a month to a million a month
00:38:14,335-->00:38:18,215-->If I was selling Casper mattresses, I would be concerned about new customer acquisition
00:38:38,380-->00:38:43,000-->And so for me, I was like, look, we have to find like, if we're producing a deodorant, we need to make sure that people love it
00:39:49,725-->00:39:55,665-->I guess really what happened is by the time people started asking that question, I was like, I was like, we're doing a million dollars a month
00:41:02,674-->00:41:06,605-->Amazon has this phrase, you know, customer obsessed is what Jeff Bezos says
00:41:23,985-->00:41:31,215-->But also right when you sign up, you get a funny email from you guys, like talk about some of the things you guys have done on the customer service or customer obsessed side
00:44:01,375-->00:44:04,045-->Send us all of your financials and your information
00:44:06,745-->00:44:09,585-->They don't even reply back for like 90 days afterwards
00:44:48,295-->00:44:52,315-->Uh, maybe the, Oh, you know, the right person internally was like, we don't really care about this business
00:46:28,525-->00:46:30,085-->And then what you do is you say, you know what
00:46:54,995-->00:46:57,455-->Yeah, I'm not sure if they have the roses or I have the roses
00:49:05,435-->00:49:07,595-->Your competitors are selling for $5 a target
00:50:54,880-->00:50:58,570-->You know, they're just like, uh, so, so you're up at 2:00 AM preparing these things for them
00:51:31,524-->00:51:35,305-->They say something and you in your head, you're like, this is the moment I need to say something
00:52:47,945-->00:52:51,245-->And we were like negotiating with the person who owned the Mark simultaneously
00:53:58,775-->00:54:00,995-->These guys are not going to go away unless we do this
00:54:51,075-->00:54:54,254-->So, so this is actually that, that mindset your brother has told me about this
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:56:50,310-->00:56:52,529-->Where did that strategy or mindset come from
00:58:17,050-->00:58:19,630-->And so that was, that gave me a lot of comfort going into the deal
00:58:55,055-->00:58:57,185-->Is this just like your marketing genius or what, what is it
00:59:28,235-->00:59:30,305-->Maybe I should buy the, you know, coconut and vanilla
01:00:42,754-->01:00:46,415-->This brand is not going to have any legs and no one's going to care without influencer advertising
01:01:07,270-->01:01:09,339-->I'm like, I know what's working in my company
01:01:42,365-->01:01:45,335-->We're going to double down on that instead of doing anything that you suggest
01:01:45,725-->01:01:50,615-->And it's hard, like, you know, for us, we had a great safety net of like a success already or like momentum
01:02:48,960-->01:02:51,630-->Like tell us you started balling out of control a little bit
01:03:15,595-->01:03:17,125-->I was like, we turned your 50 K to a million dollars
01:05:09,920-->01:05:13,965-->And I was like, wow, these people like care, understand the business and want to make sure
01:06:49,020-->01:06:51,840-->If you were 21 today, what business would you want to go start
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:08:17,770-->01:08:21,010-->If you don't have any resources and don't have any technical knowledge, you can still do
01:09:18,929-->01:09:23,580-->But if you're in and you're like starting a business and it's got some traction and you're like, Hey, how do I start scaling this
