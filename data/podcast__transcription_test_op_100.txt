00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:00:12,320-->00:00:17,840-->So why would anyone be interested in investing in a category that only has $30 million a year run rates
00:00:18,110-->00:00:31,320-->And I was like, if the natural deodorant industry is $30 million a year where the entire natural deodorant, we're doing $30 million a year at this point, Okay
00:01:24,585-->00:01:27,255-->And the tactics that he shared are actually quite insightful
00:02:22,065-->00:02:25,245-->So where are you when you have the idea for native deodorant
00:02:48,260-->00:02:53,270-->And you know, I've been seeing this problem for the last four years since I've been buying the deodorant from Dwayne Reed
00:03:09,565-->00:03:16,915-->And it'll be on my body for 23 hours and 45 minutes for the next 60 years, I should at least be able to pronounce some of the ingredients in this thing
00:03:19,170-->00:03:23,100-->And then my sister gets pregnant and she's telling me how she's using dove
00:04:19,630-->00:04:25,810-->And what it does is aluminum acts as like a plug to block your sweat glands from excluding sweat
00:04:55,260-->00:04:57,150-->And so that's the way I thought about sweating
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:07:05,815-->00:07:08,424-->Generally they're buying a Duane Reades and Walmarts and targets
00:07:27,845-->00:07:30,995-->I put it on product hunt, product hunt has multiple pages
00:08:24,620-->00:08:26,930-->And what was the little tagline at that time
00:10:04,605-->00:10:06,675-->Um, so does my sister cause she's pregnant
00:10:16,454-->00:10:23,055-->I'm not sure if it's my personal body chemistry or what it is, but yeah, w we were testing natural deodorants left and right from Etsy
00:11:12,355-->00:11:20,214-->And so we're shipping these boxes out, we shipped 60 out and then sales start dropping because you know, we're off the product hunt and I'm like, okay
00:12:35,445-->00:12:39,765-->I had the click-through rate, the CPA, the return on investment
00:12:39,915-->00:12:46,875-->And I started doing that every day, starting, you know, probably, uh, August, 2015, or maybe September, 2015
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:14:25,655-->00:14:28,085-->And so I'm like, okay, maybe this business is over
00:16:35,905-->00:16:38,365-->So that's my genuine recommendation for hustle con
00:16:39,475-->00:16:42,265-->Let me give this to you guys so that you can get a discount
00:16:45,105-->00:16:47,925-->My first million, all caps, all one word again
00:17:00,755-->00:17:03,785-->You got to figure out your travel to get there, but I'll buy your tickets to the conference itself
00:17:31,439-->00:17:35,070-->He gave, it was like an hour long conversation and I probably said five words
00:17:56,385-->00:17:58,845-->I'm not going to like, uh, you know, bankrupt the business
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:20:28,885-->00:20:31,165-->And you're like, wait, I I'm better than this
00:20:50,370-->00:20:53,250-->And so, you know, look what had been happening is that okay
00:21:17,490-->00:21:21,240-->And so for a while, we've been attempting to make a better deodorant, like a better formula
00:21:42,520-->00:21:44,590-->Solomon's like, you're running the washer and dryer every day
00:22:04,975-->00:22:07,524-->You found a manufacturer just by Googling who the heck makes deodorant
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:23:36,450-->00:23:39,330-->It allows us to have a really flexible supply chain two
00:23:53,080-->00:23:55,570-->Great the day I go over there and terrible the next day
00:24:13,014-->00:24:17,605-->When you, when I build, I build products that are like software and software, it's pretty easy to iterate
00:25:33,790-->00:25:35,890-->If you like it, leave a review on our website
00:25:37,180-->00:25:39,525-->And if you hate it, Please reply back to this email
00:26:39,949-->00:26:42,439-->And so that's how we AB test formula change
00:26:53,255-->00:26:56,305-->Therefore we believe this formula is that's exactly right
00:27:12,370-->00:27:14,229-->We're getting into the weeds as much as possible
00:28:41,465-->00:28:44,555-->Um, you know, six weeks later, we'll start seeing repeat purchase rates
00:32:08,955-->00:32:10,395-->And there's not a whole bunch of other examples
00:32:35,139-->00:32:37,419-->And even on Pinterest, we're seeing a good return on investment
00:33:01,445-->00:33:05,315-->I would want to maximize these sort of earnings per capita in my company
00:33:09,815-->00:33:12,085-->Because you're doing it as a one man show one
00:33:42,179-->00:33:45,510-->And so we're like, you know, we've got some cash, but not a ton of cash
00:35:11,050-->00:35:16,300-->And Michael Scott, you were Dwight on Sam, you were Daryl in the warehouse
00:36:56,390-->00:36:59,900-->And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now
00:37:01,130-->00:37:04,120-->Business to grow from that a hundred K a month to a million a month
00:38:08,865-->00:38:14,165-->Tell you, Hey, repeat purchase rate is the thing to key in on, I think for like, uh, it depends on the product you're in
00:38:18,215-->00:38:20,645-->Cause how many mattresses is someone going to buy it
00:39:29,280-->00:39:31,950-->They're not, I mean, what's the, I almost don't even think about it
00:39:49,725-->00:39:55,665-->I guess really what happened is by the time people started asking that question, I was like, I was like, we're doing a million dollars a month
00:40:34,790-->00:40:37,640-->And we're just like, I think this is a product that people want and need
00:42:51,875-->00:42:53,314-->Now you're doing a million dollars a month
00:44:14,300-->00:44:19,730-->Just give me a heads up because you know, at this point, uh, you know, we've started a process and we're talking to a bunch of other parties
00:44:23,810-->00:44:33,220-->But just radio, silence, like being ghosted from an ex or from like a, you know, a Tinder date is what's happening and where they, you think they were just picking your brain to get the numbers from you
00:44:48,295-->00:44:52,315-->Uh, maybe the, Oh, you know, the right person internally was like, we don't really care about this business
00:45:41,339-->00:45:43,140-->We send it out to a bunch of potential acquirers
00:45:54,299-->00:45:56,430-->Let's let you know, probably 120 pages long
00:46:49,405-->00:46:54,605-->And so on, like the bachelor you're, you're sitting there with the batch of the roses and you're you invite them all to the
00:46:54,995-->00:46:57,455-->Yeah, I'm not sure if they have the roses or I have the roses
00:48:52,865-->00:48:56,195-->Do you know how to make other products with the word native on them, help us do that
00:49:03,545-->00:49:05,435-->And so like a couple of guys are like, you know what
00:49:46,395-->00:49:50,445-->And did you, what did you internally, what did you internally think about this
00:49:50,535-->00:49:53,025-->You know, are you dreaming about a certain number
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:50:00,424-->00:50:08,169-->And I'm just like, we generated, you know, 4 million in revenue this year, this month add another zero to that price buddy, add two more zeros
00:51:55,875-->00:52:01,185-->And two, I remember one guy who, who was like the CEO of the company was like, you know, trying to judge my marketing ability
00:52:06,575-->00:52:11,705-->Uh, and as like, I know that, uh, like I was like, this is one of those things where you think either I'm intelligent or I'm an idiot
00:53:58,775-->00:54:00,995-->These guys are not going to go away unless we do this
00:54:26,800-->00:54:33,640-->Cause like, uh, I never felt it wasn't a, we with my investors, like they were all like super happy and super excited about getting the deal done
00:54:44,964-->00:54:49,435-->So I don't know who those investors are, do, Michael, but he, I hope he should mention their name
00:55:25,109-->00:55:32,069-->And like, you know, in the last six months, I don't even remember what, but they invest in a refillable theater company and I'm like, well, I see that you're doing a refillable deodorant now
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:56:37,330-->00:56:45,069-->You know, uh, we, we go after them 10 times harder, you know, like, uh, Donald Trump has always like, we're building this wall 10 feet higher
00:57:14,870-->00:57:16,940-->But if he's got it himself, for sure, I love it
00:57:23,310-->00:57:25,140-->How did it feel and where are you guys at now
00:57:43,640-->00:57:45,799-->Why did the first acquire or not end up buying you
00:57:53,310-->00:57:55,590-->They were like, you know, they came out to San Francisco
00:58:00,420-->00:58:03,210-->And they're like, this is how it's going to be post acquisition
00:58:04,650-->00:58:06,120-->This is how we're thinking about the business
00:58:35,505-->00:58:41,745-->Native coconut and vanilla is the bestselling name, uh, deodorant skew at target over the last 52 weeks
00:58:41,745-->00:58:43,694-->And we haven't even been there for 52 weeks
00:58:55,055-->00:58:57,185-->Is this just like your marketing genius or what, what is it
01:00:18,080-->01:00:22,280-->What do you think is the message for the next you who maybe doesn't have the sort of
01:00:42,754-->01:00:46,415-->This brand is not going to have any legs and no one's going to care without influencer advertising
01:01:32,795-->01:01:37,415-->And for me, like, Well, it gave me a lot of confidence was, you know, things were working early on
01:03:15,595-->01:03:17,125-->I was like, we turned your 50 K to a million dollars
01:03:54,855-->01:03:57,915-->And like my family's in town to help celebrate, which is really fun
01:04:13,085-->01:04:17,515-->And like one of the things I realized afterwards, cause you know, all these people are like, Oh, being ready, which is not that great
01:04:56,090-->01:04:59,420-->It's like the people that work there and how devoted they are to the business
01:05:09,920-->01:05:13,965-->And I was like, wow, these people like care, understand the business and want to make sure
01:06:10,040-->01:06:11,810-->And like, that's definitely something I do
01:06:38,070-->01:06:40,630-->If you were 21 today, starting from scratch
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:07:29,930-->01:07:31,620-->Everything is really cheap out of the gate
01:09:38,035-->01:09:39,775-->This, this is what I like to do on the weekends
