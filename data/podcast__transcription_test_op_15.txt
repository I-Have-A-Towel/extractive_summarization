00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:04:14,019-->00:04:19,360-->Aluminum is probably the largest thing that we're like, people are concerned about when it comes to the deodorant category
00:06:08,594-->00:06:13,635-->I really liked what it stood for, which was like, we want to use ingredients that were like native to the earth
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:14:18,814-->00:14:21,095-->I don't really want to be making these deodorants in my apartment
00:15:02,105-->00:15:07,415-->And the meantime I'm like Googling and I'm like, okay, Who makes deodorants, like I've got a formula I want to make
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:31:15,475-->00:31:17,514-->And what does that mean for a deodorant business
00:36:02,015-->00:36:06,755-->Sir, we hired another person, a third, uh, the third person to join the team and he's doing customer service
00:36:56,390-->00:36:59,900-->And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now
00:41:02,674-->00:41:06,605-->Amazon has this phrase, you know, customer obsessed is what Jeff Bezos says
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
01:03:23,065-->01:03:24,715-->I'm gonna go back to them and show them this deal
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
