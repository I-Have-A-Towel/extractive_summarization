00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:16:21,875-->00:16:35,875-->If you're thinking about starting an idea, A business or you are, you want to do that someday, or you're doing it right now, either way, listening to speakers, tell their stories, being in the audience, amongst a bunch of other like-minded people that is a really, really good way to get amongst it
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:30:12,774-->00:30:15,415-->You know, they hear you say we're only at a hundred thousand a month in revenue
00:36:02,015-->00:36:06,755-->Sir, we hired another person, a third, uh, the third person to join the team and he's doing customer service
00:36:56,390-->00:36:59,900-->And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
01:01:45,725-->01:01:50,615-->And it's hard, like, you know, for us, we had a great safety net of like a success already or like momentum
