At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year. Aluminum is probably the largest thing that we're like, people are concerned about when it comes to the deodorant category. I really liked what it stood for, which was like, we want to use ingredients that were like native to the earth. And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015. And she's like, we're going to scale this business. I don't really want to be making these deodorants in my apartment. And the meantime I'm like Googling and I'm like, okay, Who makes deodorants, like I've got a formula I want to make. It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer. And what does that mean for a deodorant business? Sir, we hired another person, a third, uh, the third person to join the team and he's doing customer service. And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now. Amazon has this phrase, you know, customer obsessed is what Jeff Bezos says. And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist. I'm gonna go back to them and show them this deal. I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing.
