00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:04:14,019-->00:04:19,360-->Aluminum is probably the largest thing that we're like, people are concerned about when it comes to the deodorant category
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:15:21,925-->00:15:29,995-->I've been two or three times to hustle con it's a conference it's happening December 2nd and third in Oakland, they rent out the paramount theater, which is really amazing venue
00:16:39,475-->00:16:42,265-->Let me give this to you guys so that you can get a discount
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:19:23,970-->00:19:26,550-->And so like, all of this is just like works out randomly
00:21:27,840-->00:21:30,870-->Is it any better than like, you know, the formula that you actually paid for
00:22:27,690-->00:22:30,930-->And in the next six months, I will be an expert on deodorant
00:27:12,370-->00:27:14,229-->We're getting into the weeds as much as possible
00:33:01,445-->00:33:05,315-->I would want to maximize these sort of earnings per capita in my company
00:33:42,179-->00:33:45,510-->And so we're like, you know, we've got some cash, but not a ton of cash
00:35:48,080-->00:35:50,570-->So we've basically doubled the business between may and June
00:36:56,390-->00:36:59,900-->And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now
00:38:08,865-->00:38:14,165-->Tell you, Hey, repeat purchase rate is the thing to key in on, I think for like, uh, it depends on the product you're in
00:41:23,985-->00:41:31,215-->But also right when you sign up, you get a funny email from you guys, like talk about some of the things you guys have done on the customer service or customer obsessed side
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:52:47,945-->00:52:51,245-->And we were like negotiating with the person who owned the Mark simultaneously
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:56:50,310-->00:56:52,529-->Where did that strategy or mindset come from
01:00:42,754-->01:00:46,415-->This brand is not going to have any legs and no one's going to care without influencer advertising
01:05:05,950-->01:05:09,920-->Like, you know, we have this contest internally to make another email funny and very human
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
