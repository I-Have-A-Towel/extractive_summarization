00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:00:12,320-->00:00:17,840-->So why would anyone be interested in investing in a category that only has $30 million a year run rates
00:04:14,019-->00:04:19,360-->Aluminum is probably the largest thing that we're like, people are concerned about when it comes to the deodorant category
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:06:00,135-->00:06:03,255-->Uh, so we launched the company in July, 2015
00:07:34,055-->00:07:36,875-->We get one sale and I'm like, okay, this business is over
00:09:43,295-->00:09:51,845-->And so he said that he said, told a story on the podcast, which was that at some point you guys were like ordering deodorants off Etsy and you're just testing deodorants
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:12:59,500-->00:13:02,290-->Do you still get hands-on with the Facebook ads
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:16:39,475-->00:16:42,265-->Let me give this to you guys so that you can get a discount
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:19:45,980-->00:19:48,620-->And I'm like, okay, well maybe this business is over again
00:20:32,455-->00:20:33,925-->I've got something that's working for me
00:20:53,310-->00:21:01,620-->Over the course of the last eight months since this, or like last four months, since this woman had been making deodorant for me, like we'd gotten a lot of customer feedback basically saying our formula was kind of mediocre
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:24:48,595-->00:24:50,544-->I was like, this is version seven of the deodorant
00:28:04,385-->00:28:08,015-->We email all the customers and we're like, Hey, look, your product was supposed to ship out today
00:30:12,774-->00:30:15,415-->You know, they hear you say we're only at a hundred thousand a month in revenue
00:30:41,515-->00:30:44,065-->We sold that business for a seven figure sum
00:39:49,725-->00:39:55,665-->I guess really what happened is by the time people started asking that question, I was like, I was like, we're doing a million dollars a month
00:41:23,985-->00:41:31,215-->But also right when you sign up, you get a funny email from you guys, like talk about some of the things you guys have done on the customer service or customer obsessed side
00:46:54,995-->00:46:57,455-->Yeah, I'm not sure if they have the roses or I have the roses
00:49:09,895-->00:49:16,404-->So we're out or we drop our price by half and then push comes to shove and P and G hasn't done a deal in like 10 years
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:51:00,160-->00:51:08,170-->So there's a bunch of them, some guy like the guys who were most interested in the business, ended up dropping out in the, uh, during the, during the acquisition conversations
00:53:30,640-->00:53:33,250-->And the music companies knew, Hey, these guys are about to sell
00:54:26,800-->00:54:33,640-->Cause like, uh, I never felt it wasn't a, we with my investors, like they were all like super happy and super excited about getting the deal done
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:58:41,745-->00:58:43,694-->And we haven't even been there for 52 weeks
01:01:07,270-->01:01:09,339-->I'm like, I know what's working in my company
01:03:57,915-->01:04:04,395-->We'd go to this like Thai restaurant for dinner, which is really fun, but like, what's shocking is like how little life has changed
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:08:50,354-->01:08:53,234-->Like, you know, I love when people have gotten skin in the game
01:09:38,035-->01:09:39,775-->This, this is what I like to do on the weekends
