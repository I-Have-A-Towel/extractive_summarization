00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:00:12,320-->00:00:17,840-->So why would anyone be interested in investing in a category that only has $30 million a year run rates
00:00:39,830-->00:00:43,430-->He is the founder of native deodorant, which is a natural deodorant brand
00:01:17,265-->00:01:21,645-->And so he sold it two and a half years later to Proctor and gamble for a hundred million dollars
00:01:24,585-->00:01:27,255-->And the tactics that he shared are actually quite insightful
00:02:35,200-->00:02:37,430-->I've lived in the same place for like four years
00:04:14,019-->00:04:19,360-->Aluminum is probably the largest thing that we're like, people are concerned about when it comes to the deodorant category
00:04:51,844-->00:04:53,854-->I don't want to take a pill to stop going to the bathroom
00:05:53,929-->00:05:56,200-->Aluminum free deodorant will do the job for you
00:05:56,385-->00:05:59,565-->And so you say we, but at the beginning it was just you correct
00:08:46,220-->00:08:48,805-->It was like, And, you know, we had gotten financial product
00:10:06,824-->00:10:14,324-->So I started testing every deodorant I could find, I tested like the Tom's remains of the world, the Schmidts of the world, the, uh, you know, the Etsy deodorants of the world
00:11:12,355-->00:11:20,214-->And so we're shipping these boxes out, we shipped 60 out and then sales start dropping because you know, we're off the product hunt and I'm like, okay
00:12:18,690-->00:12:21,030-->She'd be like, go quit this business tomorrow
00:13:34,250-->00:13:39,709-->I used to be selling products at a farmer's market, and now I'm making 500 dealers for you a week
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:15:35,545-->00:15:55,245-->So when I went under, we work was talking at the, let me look at the list for this year, hymns, the founder of Madison Reed, Strava calm method, and Ali lime, a bunch of CEOs and founders of multi-billion dollar companies and startups that come on stage and share insights about how they did what they did, how they got started and how SoCon is very different than a normal conference
00:16:06,275-->00:16:10,204-->So they are not only sharing good insights on the stage, but you get to meet them afterwards
00:16:13,175-->00:16:18,214-->In fact, I'm bringing out the editor of this podcast to come because I just think it's a really great opportunity
00:16:21,875-->00:16:35,875-->If you're thinking about starting an idea, A business or you are, you want to do that someday, or you're doing it right now, either way, listening to speakers, tell their stories, being in the audience, amongst a bunch of other like-minded people that is a really, really good way to get amongst it
00:16:35,905-->00:16:38,365-->So that's my genuine recommendation for hustle con
00:16:39,475-->00:16:42,265-->Let me give this to you guys so that you can get a discount
00:17:31,439-->00:17:35,070-->He gave, it was like an hour long conversation and I probably said five words
00:18:18,455-->00:18:24,425-->We're probably doing around, uh, 75 K in revenue a month and things are starting to scale well, wow
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:19:45,980-->00:19:48,620-->And I'm like, okay, well maybe this business is over again
00:19:48,649-->00:19:51,170-->Like, you know, we, we moved to a new manufacturer
00:20:37,555-->00:20:39,715-->So like our one I'm like, forget this business hour too
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:23:53,080-->00:23:55,570-->Great the day I go over there and terrible the next day
00:24:35,875-->00:24:41,995-->And the beginning, what we do is we send out samples to our best customers who would like were vocal and be like, Hey, I love your deodorant
00:24:48,595-->00:24:50,544-->I was like, this is version seven of the deodorant
00:25:33,790-->00:25:35,890-->If you like it, leave a review on our website
00:26:19,695-->00:26:22,545-->That's kind of amazing is that standard, cause I've never heard
00:26:23,689-->00:26:29,570-->Cause like we have this direct relationship with consumers that allows us to monitor, repeat purchase rates and have a direct line of communication with them
00:26:39,949-->00:26:42,439-->And so that's how we AB test formula change
00:27:58,535-->00:28:02,885-->So we switched formula basically because we have to, we think it's supposed to be better
00:28:15,095-->00:28:20,495-->Like, you know, deodorant's not something you can really go without like, you know, like toothpaste, I need this
00:30:12,774-->00:30:15,415-->You know, they hear you say we're only at a hundred thousand a month in revenue
00:31:15,475-->00:31:17,514-->And what does that mean for a deodorant business
00:32:08,955-->00:32:10,395-->And there's not a whole bunch of other examples
00:33:42,179-->00:33:45,510-->And so we're like, you know, we've got some cash, but not a ton of cash
00:35:42,230-->00:35:44,180-->Like, you know, it's just taking up so much of my time
00:36:02,015-->00:36:06,755-->Sir, we hired another person, a third, uh, the third person to join the team and he's doing customer service
00:36:07,085-->00:36:09,335-->And I was like, great, this is wonderful
00:37:01,130-->00:37:04,120-->Business to grow from that a hundred K a month to a million a month
00:37:07,990-->00:37:10,240-->Did you guys, obviously the formula is getting better
00:37:24,780-->00:37:28,380-->It's a lot easier to have word of mouth when you're doing 250 K 500 a month
00:39:29,280-->00:39:31,950-->They're not, I mean, what's the, I almost don't even think about it
00:39:49,725-->00:39:55,665-->I guess really what happened is by the time people started asking that question, I was like, I was like, we're doing a million dollars a month
00:41:02,674-->00:41:06,605-->Amazon has this phrase, you know, customer obsessed is what Jeff Bezos says
00:41:23,985-->00:41:31,215-->But also right when you sign up, you get a funny email from you guys, like talk about some of the things you guys have done on the customer service or customer obsessed side
00:42:51,875-->00:42:53,314-->Now you're doing a million dollars a month
00:44:06,745-->00:44:09,585-->They don't even reply back for like 90 days afterwards
00:45:22,810-->00:45:28,839-->Um, this is like, you know, look, there are so many different emotions that happen all the time when you're trying to sell a business
00:46:57,485-->00:47:07,085-->I still don't know, but yeah, we invite them all to the party and they're here and they're like, you know, I talked to them, uh, and like, you know, businesses send out like some businesses will send out one guy
00:49:22,015-->00:49:31,935-->Like I know how, you know, Unilever operates and I know how these private equity firms operate, but P and G nobody's seen them in the world in 10 years, Agra, just to do a deal like this
00:49:44,955-->00:49:46,335-->We're letting everyone come in with beds
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:50:38,015-->00:50:41,944-->We send out millions of emails a month and you want this from the beginning of the time that we launched the business
00:53:58,775-->00:54:00,995-->These guys are not going to go away unless we do this
00:54:26,800-->00:54:33,640-->Cause like, uh, I never felt it wasn't a, we with my investors, like they were all like super happy and super excited about getting the deal done
00:55:06,090-->00:55:09,840-->I will publicly write the wrong for the next 50 years
00:55:12,600-->00:55:17,540-->I'll give you an example right now, this company called, they said no to us
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:57:14,870-->00:57:16,940-->But if he's got it himself, for sure, I love it
00:57:23,310-->00:57:25,140-->How did it feel and where are you guys at now
00:58:00,420-->00:58:03,210-->And they're like, this is how it's going to be post acquisition
00:58:04,650-->00:58:06,120-->This is how we're thinking about the business
00:58:17,050-->00:58:19,630-->And so that was, that gave me a lot of comfort going into the deal
00:58:41,745-->00:58:43,694-->And we haven't even been there for 52 weeks
00:59:04,165-->00:59:12,355-->You don't have to go through the entire deodorant stick before you can get rid of it in the same way that you're not like if you open up a diet Coke, cause you want to like treat yourself, you don't have to drink the whole thing
00:59:24,065-->00:59:25,865-->And then you're like, this was a great deodorant
01:00:36,964-->01:00:39,754-->So people PR so you can prove this as a repeatable model
01:03:07,045-->01:03:08,485-->Do you have, do you have a few moments today
01:03:23,065-->01:03:24,715-->I'm gonna go back to them and show them this deal
01:04:56,090-->01:04:59,420-->It's like the people that work there and how devoted they are to the business
01:05:05,950-->01:05:09,920-->Like, you know, we have this contest internally to make another email funny and very human
01:05:18,075-->01:05:21,345-->I have no idea how they were motivated to do that and they're that way
01:06:10,040-->01:06:11,810-->And like, that's definitely something I do
01:06:49,020-->01:06:51,840-->If you were 21 today, what business would you want to go start
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:07:29,930-->01:07:31,620-->Everything is really cheap out of the gate
01:07:35,430-->01:07:40,080-->And you will find something that works like, you know, even if you have to like go through a bunch of products and you're like, you know what
01:08:01,125-->01:08:04,785-->I don't have a direct line of communication with people who use my product every day
01:08:27,670-->01:08:30,630-->And I'm listening to this and I'm like, this guy is awesome
01:08:59,774-->01:09:01,844-->I'm like, look, if you're thinking about doing this, quit your job
01:09:18,929-->01:09:23,580-->But if you're in and you're like starting a business and it's got some traction and you're like, Hey, how do I start scaling this
01:09:38,035-->01:09:39,775-->This, this is what I like to do on the weekends
