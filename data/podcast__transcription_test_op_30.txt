00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:00:12,320-->00:00:17,840-->So why would anyone be interested in investing in a category that only has $30 million a year run rates
00:01:24,585-->00:01:27,255-->And the tactics that he shared are actually quite insightful
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:11:12,355-->00:11:20,214-->And so we're shipping these boxes out, we shipped 60 out and then sales start dropping because you know, we're off the product hunt and I'm like, okay
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:13:34,250-->00:13:39,709-->I used to be selling products at a farmer's market, and now I'm making 500 dealers for you a week
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:13:53,770-->00:13:56,140-->Two days later, she calls me and she's like, my son is sick
00:14:18,814-->00:14:21,095-->I don't really want to be making these deodorants in my apartment
00:16:13,175-->00:16:18,214-->In fact, I'm bringing out the editor of this podcast to come because I just think it's a really great opportunity
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:26:56,635-->00:27:07,419-->But we're doing like tiny changes, like, you know, like changes that wouldn't even influence the ingredient tackle that we're like, Hey look, do you think we should put in, you know, Uh, 1% of this ingredient or 1
00:27:07,419-->00:27:09,189-->05% of this to see what's better
00:27:30,629-->00:27:33,090-->We're not setting up any more of these deodorants that are lotion
00:29:34,870-->00:29:40,840-->Uh, I was not, uh, you know, in Silicon Valley, there's a lot of people that whole thing to do is say, I'm here to change the world
00:33:42,179-->00:33:45,510-->And so we're like, you know, we've got some cash, but not a ton of cash
00:41:02,674-->00:41:06,605-->Amazon has this phrase, you know, customer obsessed is what Jeff Bezos says
00:44:41,785-->00:44:48,265-->And I think that it was also just like, uh, you know, th they have their own business and they're like, you know, maybe this is too small, we're a billion dollar business
00:48:44,225-->00:48:46,595-->And so one of the things that we sell is like the sizzle, right
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:50:00,424-->00:50:08,169-->And I'm just like, we generated, you know, 4 million in revenue this year, this month add another zero to that price buddy, add two more zeros
00:51:55,875-->00:52:01,185-->And two, I remember one guy who, who was like the CEO of the company was like, you know, trying to judge my marketing ability
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:57:43,640-->00:57:45,799-->Why did the first acquire or not end up buying you
00:57:53,310-->00:57:55,590-->They were like, you know, they came out to San Francisco
00:58:04,650-->00:58:06,120-->This is how we're thinking about the business
01:00:36,964-->01:00:39,754-->So people PR so you can prove this as a repeatable model
01:05:05,950-->01:05:09,920-->Like, you know, we have this contest internally to make another email funny and very human
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:08:01,125-->01:08:04,785-->I don't have a direct line of communication with people who use my product every day
