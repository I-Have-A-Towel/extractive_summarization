00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:01:24,585-->00:01:27,255-->And the tactics that he shared are actually quite insightful
00:03:17,040-->00:03:19,019-->And so that's really where the problem starts
00:04:14,019-->00:04:19,360-->Aluminum is probably the largest thing that we're like, people are concerned about when it comes to the deodorant category
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:06:20,575-->00:06:22,735-->Cause I don't think that that's necessarily the case
00:10:16,454-->00:10:23,055-->I'm not sure if it's my personal body chemistry or what it is, but yeah, w we were testing natural deodorants left and right from Etsy
00:10:42,605-->00:10:46,925-->I get a bunch of crinkle paper delivered to the house with wonderful is my brother is the messiest
00:11:12,355-->00:11:20,214-->And so we're shipping these boxes out, we shipped 60 out and then sales start dropping because you know, we're off the product hunt and I'm like, okay
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:15:35,545-->00:15:55,245-->So when I went under, we work was talking at the, let me look at the list for this year, hymns, the founder of Madison Reed, Strava calm method, and Ali lime, a bunch of CEOs and founders of multi-billion dollar companies and startups that come on stage and share insights about how they did what they did, how they got started and how SoCon is very different than a normal conference
00:16:21,875-->00:16:35,875-->If you're thinking about starting an idea, A business or you are, you want to do that someday, or you're doing it right now, either way, listening to speakers, tell their stories, being in the audience, amongst a bunch of other like-minded people that is a really, really good way to get amongst it
00:17:59,235-->00:18:01,305-->I don't have to mortgage my house based on this
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:20:32,455-->00:20:33,925-->I've got something that's working for me
