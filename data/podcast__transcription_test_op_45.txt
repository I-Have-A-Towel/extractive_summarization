00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:01:24,585-->00:01:27,255-->And the tactics that he shared are actually quite insightful
00:03:17,040-->00:03:19,019-->And so that's really where the problem starts
00:04:14,019-->00:04:19,360-->Aluminum is probably the largest thing that we're like, people are concerned about when it comes to the deodorant category
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:06:20,575-->00:06:22,735-->Cause I don't think that that's necessarily the case
00:10:16,454-->00:10:23,055-->I'm not sure if it's my personal body chemistry or what it is, but yeah, w we were testing natural deodorants left and right from Etsy
00:10:42,605-->00:10:46,925-->I get a bunch of crinkle paper delivered to the house with wonderful is my brother is the messiest
00:11:12,355-->00:11:20,214-->And so we're shipping these boxes out, we shipped 60 out and then sales start dropping because you know, we're off the product hunt and I'm like, okay
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:15:35,545-->00:15:55,245-->So when I went under, we work was talking at the, let me look at the list for this year, hymns, the founder of Madison Reed, Strava calm method, and Ali lime, a bunch of CEOs and founders of multi-billion dollar companies and startups that come on stage and share insights about how they did what they did, how they got started and how SoCon is very different than a normal conference
00:16:21,875-->00:16:35,875-->If you're thinking about starting an idea, A business or you are, you want to do that someday, or you're doing it right now, either way, listening to speakers, tell their stories, being in the audience, amongst a bunch of other like-minded people that is a really, really good way to get amongst it
00:17:59,235-->00:18:01,305-->I don't have to mortgage my house based on this
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:20:32,455-->00:20:33,925-->I've got something that's working for me
00:21:48,900-->00:21:50,700-->So how are you even figuring out the formula
00:24:53,095-->00:24:55,044-->They're blah, like, you know, you don't know what's in then
00:27:30,629-->00:27:33,090-->We're not setting up any more of these deodorants that are lotion
00:30:23,225-->00:30:25,865-->Was it, you know, were you already doing well financially
00:31:15,475-->00:31:17,514-->And what does that mean for a deodorant business
00:33:42,179-->00:33:45,510-->And so we're like, you know, we've got some cash, but not a ton of cash
00:34:35,925-->00:34:38,835-->So you're saying Saturday, Saturdays is customer service day
00:36:56,390-->00:36:59,900-->And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now
00:37:10,299-->00:37:16,569-->So obviously the product is getting better, but is it just, is it just like that it's a million little things getting better or was there a breakthrough or a
00:37:16,770-->00:37:18,480-->Point of emphasis that really was highlighted
00:40:55,475-->00:40:57,335-->Taking a shot every time you say customer service, they're dead
00:42:51,875-->00:42:53,314-->Now you're doing a million dollars a month
00:45:09,595-->00:45:12,110-->And I was like, No, uh, I'm not going through this again
00:46:54,995-->00:46:57,455-->Yeah, I'm not sure if they have the roses or I have the roses
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:50:00,424-->00:50:08,169-->And I'm just like, we generated, you know, 4 million in revenue this year, this month add another zero to that price buddy, add two more zeros
00:50:45,725-->00:50:53,555-->And I was like, the board is going to go through emails because even I barely like, I mean, I look at that, but I don't look at that on like a quarterly basis
00:50:58,630-->00:51:00,160-->And there's like a bunch of these acquirers
00:51:40,674-->00:51:46,044-->And there are these key moments that are just happening over a coffee or on the phone or whatever
00:55:41,490-->00:55:45,600-->But like, you know, do what you gotta do, but you could have had the opera, you had the opportunity for years
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:56:58,819-->00:57:01,100-->I think he just does a better job of like hiding it
00:57:14,870-->00:57:16,940-->But if he's got it himself, for sure, I love it
00:58:00,420-->00:58:03,210-->And they're like, this is how it's going to be post acquisition
01:00:11,330-->01:00:15,620-->You didn't know anything about deodorant, you went in with basically no money, no staff, no nothing
01:03:43,675-->01:03:46,555-->Anyway, we closed the deal, you know, money hits the bank
01:04:40,160-->01:04:44,090-->And I was like, you know, if a bus hits me on the way to work, I'm still going to get to work
01:05:05,950-->01:05:09,920-->Like, you know, we have this contest internally to make another email funny and very human
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:08:23,590-->01:08:27,069-->If you chose that category is, do not disconnect yourself with the consumer
