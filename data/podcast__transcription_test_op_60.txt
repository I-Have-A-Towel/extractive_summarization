00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:01:24,585-->00:01:27,255-->And the tactics that he shared are actually quite insightful
00:02:25,580-->00:02:29,000-->So I'm in New York city running another e-commerce business
00:02:35,200-->00:02:37,430-->I've lived in the same place for like four years
00:02:53,575-->00:02:56,575-->And, you know, I'm an attorney, I'm not a dumb guy
00:04:19,630-->00:04:25,810-->And what it does is aluminum acts as like a plug to block your sweat glands from excluding sweat
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:14:18,814-->00:14:21,095-->I don't really want to be making these deodorants in my apartment
00:15:12,055-->00:15:15,835-->So as you guys know, this podcast is published by the hustle
00:16:35,905-->00:16:38,365-->So that's my genuine recommendation for hustle con
00:21:21,450-->00:21:27,810-->And I'd been sending out samples to people and saying like, you know, our best customers who are like communicating with me and I'd be like, Hey, what do you think of this formula
00:22:43,980-->00:22:46,050-->Like the science that I was supposed to do
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:23:33,120-->00:23:36,450-->All of our deodorants are made in the United States, uh, for two reasons, one you're right
00:23:41,790-->00:23:45,150-->So like, you know, when we give them a purchase order, they're able to make it much faster
00:24:10,060-->00:24:12,850-->And we're going to jump back into the story, but one more tactical piece
00:25:10,580-->00:25:13,070-->So this must have been kind of unusual for people, I guess
00:25:22,960-->00:25:26,050-->If you buy directly from us, we were following up with every customer
00:26:10,585-->00:26:14,605-->And as a result, it must be that that's the formula that we sent to the Sams of the world are better
00:26:39,949-->00:26:42,439-->And so that's how we AB test formula change
00:27:33,120-->00:27:36,540-->We're either going to refund the customers and close the business or do something
00:28:15,095-->00:28:20,495-->Like, you know, deodorant's not something you can really go without like, you know, like toothpaste, I need this
00:29:12,500-->00:29:18,470-->Just me at the company I'm doing with customer service have a really good idea of what the problems are at the company doing the operation
00:30:12,774-->00:30:15,415-->You know, they hear you say we're only at a hundred thousand a month in revenue
00:33:01,445-->00:33:05,315-->I would want to maximize these sort of earnings per capita in my company
00:35:50,885-->00:35:54,305-->And the customer service inquiries have gotten to be even more than she can
00:36:02,015-->00:36:06,755-->Sir, we hired another person, a third, uh, the third person to join the team and he's doing customer service
00:39:49,725-->00:39:55,665-->I guess really what happened is by the time people started asking that question, I was like, I was like, we're doing a million dollars a month
00:43:13,629-->00:43:18,160-->Why, why decide to sell when things are sort of when the going is good and I'm going to ask you how you sold it
00:43:58,475-->00:44:01,375-->I went out to meet with them and you know, they're like, okay, great
00:45:09,595-->00:45:12,110-->And I was like, No, uh, I'm not going through this again
00:45:22,810-->00:45:28,839-->Um, this is like, you know, look, there are so many different emotions that happen all the time when you're trying to sell a business
00:45:46,020-->00:45:48,060-->Or, Oh, like, they're like, yeah, we're interested in this business
00:46:54,995-->00:46:57,455-->Yeah, I'm not sure if they have the roses or I have the roses
00:46:57,485-->00:47:07,085-->I still don't know, but yeah, we invite them all to the party and they're here and they're like, you know, I talked to them, uh, and like, you know, businesses send out like some businesses will send out one guy
00:47:25,529-->00:47:35,490-->And so, so we go through this process with a bunch of these guys, and then what we say is like, look here, look, if you're still interested in this business, here's all the data, here's all the diligence that you need in the business
00:49:16,435-->00:49:18,835-->This is the first acquisition they're making in 10 years
00:49:22,015-->00:49:31,935-->Like I know how, you know, Unilever operates and I know how these private equity firms operate, but P and G nobody's seen them in the world in 10 years, Agra, just to do a deal like this
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:51:55,875-->00:52:01,185-->And two, I remember one guy who, who was like the CEO of the company was like, you know, trying to judge my marketing ability
00:54:20,024-->00:54:24,105-->But, uh, these are the crazy stories that happen at the end of the deal or, you know, right
00:54:26,800-->00:54:33,640-->Cause like, uh, I never felt it wasn't a, we with my investors, like they were all like super happy and super excited about getting the deal done
00:55:38,129-->00:55:41,399-->Like, you know, you know that you're doing this and I know that you're doing this right
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:56:50,310-->00:56:52,529-->Where did that strategy or mindset come from
00:56:54,779-->00:56:58,790-->Like competitiveness with him or I think it came from him
00:57:43,640-->00:57:45,799-->Why did the first acquire or not end up buying you
01:00:42,754-->01:00:46,415-->This brand is not going to have any legs and no one's going to care without influencer advertising
01:01:07,270-->01:01:09,339-->I'm like, I know what's working in my company
01:02:48,960-->01:02:51,630-->Like tell us you started balling out of control a little bit
01:03:57,915-->01:04:04,395-->We'd go to this like Thai restaurant for dinner, which is really fun, but like, what's shocking is like how little life has changed
01:05:40,330-->01:05:42,910-->Yeah, I do this, this and this, this change
01:06:06,680-->01:06:09,620-->I'm taking the $22 one because I want shrimp tonight
01:06:35,230-->01:06:37,690-->And that's like an amazing, amazing high
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:07:43,530-->01:07:45,840-->Now I'm trying to sell something like a, you know, deodorant, right
01:08:50,354-->01:08:53,234-->Like, you know, I love when people have gotten skin in the game
