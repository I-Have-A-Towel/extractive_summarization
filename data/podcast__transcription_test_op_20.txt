00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:05:06,780-->00:05:12,180-->And so that, that was like the Genesis of like, okay, look, we think we can create a deodorant that does the job of an, a
00:05:12,434-->00:05:25,184-->Antiperspirant the other way I thought about it was look like a lot of us work in office environments, where we commute in a car, we get to an office, we sit at a desk and work at a computer and, you know, using an antiperspirant everyday
00:07:27,845-->00:07:30,995-->I put it on product hunt, product hunt has multiple pages
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:19:30,000-->00:19:32,700-->I want to have another meeting because I think there's a problem with the deodorants
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:26:56,635-->00:27:07,419-->But we're doing like tiny changes, like, you know, like changes that wouldn't even influence the ingredient tackle that we're like, Hey look, do you think we should put in, you know, Uh, 1% of this ingredient or 1
00:27:07,419-->00:27:09,189-->05% of this to see what's better
00:29:12,500-->00:29:18,470-->Just me at the company I'm doing with customer service have a really good idea of what the problems are at the company doing the operation
00:30:12,774-->00:30:15,415-->You know, they hear you say we're only at a hundred thousand a month in revenue
00:33:01,445-->00:33:05,315-->I would want to maximize these sort of earnings per capita in my company
00:36:56,390-->00:36:59,900-->And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now
00:37:10,299-->00:37:16,569-->So obviously the product is getting better, but is it just, is it just like that it's a million little things getting better or was there a breakthrough or a
00:37:16,770-->00:37:18,480-->Point of emphasis that really was highlighted
00:40:34,790-->00:40:37,640-->And we're just like, I think this is a product that people want and need
00:41:02,674-->00:41:06,605-->Amazon has this phrase, you know, customer obsessed is what Jeff Bezos says
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:50:00,424-->00:50:08,169-->And I'm just like, we generated, you know, 4 million in revenue this year, this month add another zero to that price buddy, add two more zeros
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
01:05:05,950-->01:05:09,920-->Like, you know, we have this contest internally to make another email funny and very human
01:05:18,075-->01:05:21,345-->I have no idea how they were motivated to do that and they're that way
01:06:38,070-->01:06:40,630-->If you were 21 today, starting from scratch
