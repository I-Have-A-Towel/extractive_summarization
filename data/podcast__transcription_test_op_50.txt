00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:00:39,830-->00:00:43,430-->He is the founder of native deodorant, which is a natural deodorant brand
00:03:09,565-->00:03:16,915-->And it'll be on my body for 23 hours and 45 minutes for the next 60 years, I should at least be able to pronounce some of the ingredients in this thing
00:06:08,594-->00:06:13,635-->I really liked what it stood for, which was like, we want to use ingredients that were like native to the earth
00:07:34,055-->00:07:36,875-->We get one sale and I'm like, okay, this business is over
00:08:24,620-->00:08:26,930-->And what was the little tagline at that time
00:10:42,605-->00:10:46,925-->I get a bunch of crinkle paper delivered to the house with wonderful is my brother is the messiest
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:11:38,069-->00:11:39,959-->We're basically one of the few guys out there
00:13:34,250-->00:13:39,709-->I used to be selling products at a farmer's market, and now I'm making 500 dealers for you a week
00:15:09,775-->00:15:12,025-->Quick break in the action to talk about hustle con
00:15:57,225-->00:15:58,365-->You know, you see a lot of people in suits
00:16:49,005-->00:16:51,365-->That'll give you 50 bucks a ticket to hustle con
00:17:56,385-->00:17:58,845-->I'm not going to like, uh, you know, bankrupt the business
00:17:59,235-->00:18:01,305-->I don't have to mortgage my house based on this
00:18:47,100-->00:18:50,130-->I rent a Zipcar and I go over there and I'm just looking at our deodorants
00:21:21,450-->00:21:27,810-->And I'd been sending out samples to people and saying like, you know, our best customers who are like communicating with me and I'd be like, Hey, what do you think of this formula
00:27:58,535-->00:28:02,885-->So we switched formula basically because we have to, we think it's supposed to be better
00:31:33,950-->00:31:39,050-->I was the only employee and I wasn't taking a salary, but I'd say on a hundred thousand dollars in business, I'm guessing
00:33:42,179-->00:33:45,510-->And so we're like, you know, we've got some cash, but not a ton of cash
00:33:47,909-->00:33:50,340-->One was super busy trying to run the business
00:34:26,634-->00:34:29,185-->And so I was like, I don't know how long we're going to be able to afford this person
00:34:48,465-->00:34:51,675-->Are you like, uh, I work 18 hours a day kind of guy or
00:35:16,810-->00:35:29,310-->You were the whole office and Toby being like, yeah, that's a terrible company days at the beginning, we get to June, we've got to hire, repeat per like, you know, we've got, Oh, we've got a higher repeat purchase rate, better reviews, you know, in June of 2016
00:36:56,390-->00:36:59,900-->And you know, I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now
00:40:34,790-->00:40:37,640-->And we're just like, I think this is a product that people want and need
00:41:02,674-->00:41:06,605-->Amazon has this phrase, you know, customer obsessed is what Jeff Bezos says
00:41:23,985-->00:41:31,215-->But also right when you sign up, you get a funny email from you guys, like talk about some of the things you guys have done on the customer service or customer obsessed side
00:43:58,475-->00:44:01,375-->I went out to meet with them and you know, they're like, okay, great
00:49:16,435-->00:49:18,835-->This is the first acquisition they're making in 10 years
00:49:22,015-->00:49:31,935-->Like I know how, you know, Unilever operates and I know how these private equity firms operate, but P and G nobody's seen them in the world in 10 years, Agra, just to do a deal like this
00:50:45,725-->00:50:53,555-->And I was like, the board is going to go through emails because even I barely like, I mean, I look at that, but I don't look at that on like a quarterly basis
00:52:23,015-->00:52:26,615-->This was a serious apart like that delayed the transaction with everybody
00:52:47,945-->00:52:51,245-->And we were like negotiating with the person who owned the Mark simultaneously
00:55:12,600-->00:55:17,540-->I'll give you an example right now, this company called, they said no to us
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:58:20,470-->00:58:28,270-->And as soon as we bought the trademark, I basically knew the deal was going to, I mean, there was only five more days, but I knew the deal was going to close since then, you know, we've grown the business a ton
00:58:41,745-->00:58:43,694-->And we haven't even been there for 52 weeks
01:01:05,020-->01:01:07,240-->And so like give your advice to somebody else
01:01:45,725-->01:01:50,615-->And it's hard, like, you know, for us, we had a great safety net of like a success already or like momentum
01:01:50,885-->01:01:54,360-->And so it's it's if you don't have that, Trust your gut
01:03:25,745-->01:03:29,734-->And so, uh, you know, I tell him, uh, you know, I need you to sign these docs in the next 24 hours
01:04:24,865-->01:04:30,925-->Like the journey of like friendships I made with all the employees that I have and like a bunch of like most of the team is still there
01:04:40,160-->01:04:44,090-->And I was like, you know, if a bus hits me on the way to work, I'm still going to get to work
01:06:10,040-->01:06:11,810-->And like, that's definitely something I do
01:06:20,560-->01:06:22,360-->And I'm less worried about the cost of airfare
01:06:38,070-->01:06:40,630-->If you were 21 today, starting from scratch
01:06:55,005-->01:06:57,405-->And I think that it can be answered in a bunch of different ways
01:07:25,980-->01:07:28,350-->I would say, look, look e-commerce is amazing
01:08:59,774-->01:09:01,844-->I'm like, look, if you're thinking about doing this, quit your job
