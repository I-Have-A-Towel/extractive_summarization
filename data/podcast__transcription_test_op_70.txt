00:00:04,160-->00:00:12,170-->At some point, we tried to raise more money and you know, the investor was like the entire natural deodorant industry is something like $30 million a year
00:01:27,555-->00:01:30,255-->But because he is a very entertaining guy, very charismatic
00:02:25,580-->00:02:29,000-->So I'm in New York city running another e-commerce business
00:03:09,565-->00:03:16,915-->And it'll be on my body for 23 hours and 45 minutes for the next 60 years, I should at least be able to pronounce some of the ingredients in this thing
00:04:19,630-->00:04:25,810-->And what it does is aluminum acts as like a plug to block your sweat glands from excluding sweat
00:06:20,575-->00:06:22,735-->Cause I don't think that that's necessarily the case
00:06:32,994-->00:06:36,984-->Bought the name in July, 2015, basically 12 days later launched the business
00:10:16,454-->00:10:23,055-->I'm not sure if it's my personal body chemistry or what it is, but yeah, w we were testing natural deodorants left and right from Etsy
00:11:23,275-->00:11:27,295-->I started contacting all these like reporters and I'm like, Hey, do you want to write it out native
00:11:32,400-->00:11:37,890-->And this was in 2015, you know, like today there's a new, natural theater at the lunches every day in 2015
00:11:38,069-->00:11:39,959-->We're basically one of the few guys out there
00:13:46,240-->00:13:47,680-->And she's like, we're going to scale this business
00:14:18,814-->00:14:21,095-->I don't really want to be making these deodorants in my apartment
00:14:32,375-->00:14:34,415-->We'd go to like the Dominican Republic or something
00:15:02,105-->00:15:07,415-->And the meantime I'm like Googling and I'm like, okay, Who makes deodorants, like I've got a formula I want to make
00:16:21,875-->00:16:35,875-->If you're thinking about starting an idea, A business or you are, you want to do that someday, or you're doing it right now, either way, listening to speakers, tell their stories, being in the audience, amongst a bunch of other like-minded people that is a really, really good way to get amongst it
00:16:35,905-->00:16:38,365-->So that's my genuine recommendation for hustle con
00:16:39,475-->00:16:42,265-->Let me give this to you guys so that you can get a discount
00:19:30,000-->00:19:32,700-->I want to have another meeting because I think there's a problem with the deodorants
00:21:46,260-->00:21:48,690-->And you're not a scientist or biochemists
00:22:37,260-->00:22:41,010-->Uh, customers will even like do diagnoses and they're like, Hey, I think it's because of this
00:23:23,470-->00:23:26,350-->It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer
00:24:13,014-->00:24:17,605-->When you, when I build, I build products that are like software and software, it's pretty easy to iterate
00:24:28,235-->00:24:31,085-->Tactically about how you iterate with a physical product
00:26:06,265-->00:26:10,345-->The Sams of the world are buying again more frequently than the Sean's of the world
00:26:23,689-->00:26:29,570-->Cause like we have this direct relationship with consumers that allows us to monitor, repeat purchase rates and have a direct line of communication with them
00:27:12,370-->00:27:14,229-->We're getting into the weeds as much as possible
00:27:53,945-->00:27:58,205-->We're either going to close this business or switch formulas, let's switch formulas and see what happens
00:29:12,500-->00:29:18,470-->Just me at the company I'm doing with customer service have a really good idea of what the problems are at the company doing the operation
00:29:34,870-->00:29:40,840-->Uh, I was not, uh, you know, in Silicon Valley, there's a lot of people that whole thing to do is say, I'm here to change the world
00:30:41,515-->00:30:44,065-->We sold that business for a seven figure sum
00:31:15,475-->00:31:17,514-->And what does that mean for a deodorant business
00:31:23,965-->00:31:25,485-->Where you break even where you're better than that
00:32:08,955-->00:32:10,395-->And there's not a whole bunch of other examples
00:33:20,115-->00:33:29,975-->So like a few months after we started and then another $250,000 in about April of 26, and this was friends and family, or this was, these were both outside investors that I had just met
00:33:42,179-->00:33:45,510-->And so we're like, you know, we've got some cash, but not a ton of cash
00:35:48,080-->00:35:50,570-->So we've basically doubled the business between may and June
00:36:11,315-->00:36:15,125-->And by like, you know, by November, 2016, we're doing a million dollars a month
00:37:10,299-->00:37:16,569-->So obviously the product is getting better, but is it just, is it just like that it's a million little things getting better or was there a breakthrough or a
00:37:16,770-->00:37:18,480-->Point of emphasis that really was highlighted
00:37:30,180-->00:37:33,030-->We're spending more on ads because we understand product market fit
00:38:18,215-->00:38:20,645-->Cause how many mattresses is someone going to buy it
00:38:24,670-->00:38:29,050-->But like when you're selling a consumable bite, like deodorant, the whole point is that people are brand loyal
00:39:49,725-->00:39:55,665-->I guess really what happened is by the time people started asking that question, I was like, I was like, we're doing a million dollars a month
00:39:57,795-->00:40:00,944-->But I do remember, like we had this one question from an investor
00:40:34,790-->00:40:37,640-->And we're just like, I think this is a product that people want and need
00:40:55,475-->00:40:57,335-->Taking a shot every time you say customer service, they're dead
00:41:02,674-->00:41:06,605-->Amazon has this phrase, you know, customer obsessed is what Jeff Bezos says
00:43:37,295-->00:43:39,515-->I think this is like, you know, this isn't serious
00:46:54,995-->00:46:57,455-->Yeah, I'm not sure if they have the roses or I have the roses
00:46:57,485-->00:47:07,085-->I still don't know, but yeah, we invite them all to the party and they're here and they're like, you know, I talked to them, uh, and like, you know, businesses send out like some businesses will send out one guy
00:49:46,395-->00:49:50,445-->And did you, what did you internally, what did you internally think about this
00:49:56,404-->00:50:00,424-->Look, you know, there are, there are times where I'm like, okay, look the month, a month closes
00:50:00,424-->00:50:08,169-->And I'm just like, we generated, you know, 4 million in revenue this year, this month add another zero to that price buddy, add two more zeros
00:50:24,660-->00:50:31,049-->And like, you know, during diligence, people are asking for random, there was one company that asked for every email that we had ever sent out
00:52:55,345-->00:52:57,835-->It's not real until the deal almost falls through
00:54:26,800-->00:54:33,640-->Cause like, uh, I never felt it wasn't a, we with my investors, like they were all like super happy and super excited about getting the deal done
00:55:06,090-->00:55:09,840-->I will publicly write the wrong for the next 50 years
00:56:04,115-->00:56:17,020-->And so I tweeted it and I was like, If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter, like before I was like, you know, you guys are a Nat, uh, and I don't care about your tiny business and I'll let you exist
00:57:14,870-->00:57:16,940-->But if he's got it himself, for sure, I love it
00:58:00,420-->00:58:03,210-->And they're like, this is how it's going to be post acquisition
00:58:55,055-->00:58:57,185-->Is this just like your marketing genius or what, what is it
00:59:28,235-->00:59:30,305-->Maybe I should buy the, you know, coconut and vanilla
01:03:15,595-->01:03:17,125-->I was like, we turned your 50 K to a million dollars
01:04:24,865-->01:04:30,925-->Like the journey of like friendships I made with all the employees that I have and like a bunch of like most of the team is still there
01:04:40,160-->01:04:44,090-->And I was like, you know, if a bus hits me on the way to work, I'm still going to get to work
01:05:57,690-->01:06:01,680-->And like, you know, now when I go to restaurants, like one of the best thing is I'm just like
01:06:38,070-->01:06:40,630-->If you were 21 today, starting from scratch
01:08:50,354-->01:08:53,234-->Like, you know, I love when people have gotten skin in the game
01:08:59,774-->01:09:01,844-->I'm like, look, if you're thinking about doing this, quit your job
