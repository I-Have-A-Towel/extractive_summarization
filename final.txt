Speaker 1:                                             00:01                                             At some point, we tried to raise more money and the investor was like, "The entire natural deodorant industry is something $30 million a year." And this was in 2015. Today, there's a new natural deodorant that lunches every day in 2015. And she's like, "We're going to scale this business."

Speaker 2:                                             00:21                                             If you're thinking about starting an idea, a business, or you want to do that someday or you're doing it right now, either way, listening to speakers tell their stories, being in the audience amongst a bunch of other like-minded people, that is a really, really good way to get amongst it. It sounds like it really paid off that you weren't just using a Chinese manufacturer [inaudible 00:00:42] they hear you say, "We're only at 100,000 a month in revenue."

Speaker 1:                                             00:47                                             We hired another person, the third person to join the team, and he's doing customer service. And I have no idea what our business will look like a year from now. And so I tweeted at (beep) and I was like, "If you're wondering when I decided to destroy your business, it was when you sent me this letter." Before I was like, "You guys are a gnat, and I don't care about your tiny business, and I'll let you exist." For us, we had that great safety net of success already or momentum.
