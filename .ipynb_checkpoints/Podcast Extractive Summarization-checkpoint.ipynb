      "All right. Hey, John and Breton, uh, wanting to send over this screen cap to give you a glimpse into what I've been working on. See if this is kind of along the lines of what, uh, get us all on the same page and make sure we're kind of all thinking the same way or how we could hone this down. So, uh, right here, this is kind of the, kind of more on earth on your side, type of like what we would set up a config to look like, uh, for the API we'd be building for the pre script build. Um, basically my thought is just hosting everything in an array where, uh, we have these different things. So like for types we can do for right now for this first basic template I'm building, I have things like an image text, um, a background element. Uh, asset is how you would swap in like different texts versus file paths for images, uh, and then different styles. So for like backgrounds, we could have a blurred image in the background, a gradient in the background, the solid in the background for an image we could, uh, have it be cropped in a circle around it, square, square triangle. And then for texts, we could have it be formatted different way, ways. So like description would be like not bold text header would be bold. Text number would be if we're like subbing in up price. Um, and then in and out, these would be the transition types that we have available in our kind of Lego blocks stuff. And length would be the time that we have it on screen. So my thought would be that we could basically, if you want it to and have total control over this API, you could, you know, define these all in some documentation and allow people to send over an object that would. Very clearly specified what they, uh, need to do, what they would like this thing to look like. Uh, once you unlock that we can build kind of the randomizer on the script side to see what assets we have available and then randomize building this all out. Uh, so that's what I was thinking from the API side. And to make that work in after effects, Breton, this is where I'm looking at you. I made a really simple template, uh, and I wanna make sure that like, this would. Uh, work, uh, or you could see this scaling up, um, to more complicated templates. So, uh, the example I have is this a monogram coffee ad for this, uh, bag of coffee. There's two images. And, um, I'll just play through what the kind of export might look like first. And again, really simple, but just these are. Would be entirely dynamic and possibly randomized, uh, things. And so that's like a super simple ad template right there. You pipe that through, uh, the four by five as well. So you can do the same stuff and we can modify this as well. Just, you know, all formatted for square. So basically you can, uh, crop it down as you need it. Um, Again, very simple. Uh, so the way that this is structured Breton is we have a couple, basically you like fill it up from the ground up and you have all these things to work from. So in our assets, we can take like a blurred image asset or a gradient asset or a solid asset. And those have different characteristics. You can change to change the different colors and stuff. You know, all about that. For images, you swap out this source image and it's cropped into a circle rounded square. Uh, regular square triangle, uh, description, texts, header, text, which is bold number, which is big and bold. Um, and the idea is that you would first, uh, in our configurations for the cloud rendering stuff, we would be able to replace the items in these kinds of base level, asset compositions. And then from there we could. Filter them up into the transition specified. So if we look in the API, you know, there's a UN in and you have a set, uh, transition types for that and an out. And so you bring an asset down into like the rotate, uh, um, rotate in composition. You link it to the Knoll that's there and it would do that. And then from there, you bring that, uh, in transition into an out transition. So if you look at the. Uh, the final assets, uh, I'm duplicating all of these Lego blocks that we have here. Uh, so like a one.one. Uh, this would be that, uh, the label image cropped into a circle and one dot two would be that, uh, brought into the slide in transition and linked to the, this in Knoll that's in there. Uh, one dot three would be one dot two brought down into the. Uh, slide out or whatever this slide down, out transition. So you build these things up and then at the very end you have it, you bring all of these in stagger them out into, um, the final export. And also we can change the length. Any of these are on screen by going into the, uh, the reason that that in transitions and the out transitions are different is one to provide variations among, uh, What, how did these things enter and exit, but also, uh, in the pre script, we just can shift this Knoll a little bit. If we want to stay on screen longer, we push it a couple seconds or less, and that can all be, uh, you know, granularly defined as we need it. Um, or based on script stuff. If we see that there's a lot of words on screen and into description and we needed to be on for four seconds rather than two, we can dynamically set that as well. Um, So, yeah, this is what I'm thinking. Uh, want to get your thoughts on how, uh, scalable this would look for more complex template wanting to get your thoughts or on, on if this is along the same lines of, of what you're kind of thinking. So, um, let me know. This is all after effects work at this point. I don't have any the script built out, but because I have, I'm scraping a lot of that data already. I don't imagine the script to be too hard. It's just. Kind of pulling, it's like replacing a source asset somewhere, cloning that, uh, composition and then like dropping it through this and linking stuff up. I don't think that should be too hard of a script to write. And, uh, it, as far as a, pre-build like as far as how long it will take, uh, I really expect that to be a pretty quick extend script script. Um, so yeah, more to come, but let's, uh, love to hear your thoughts on all this.\n"
