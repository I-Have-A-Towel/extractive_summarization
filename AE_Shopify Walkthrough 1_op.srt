00:00:19,065-->00:00:31,085-->So, uh, right here, this is kind of the, kind of more on earth on your side, type of like what we would set up a config to look like, uh, for the API we'd be building for the pre script build

00:04:25,725-->00:04:30,645-->Uh, the final assets, uh, I'm duplicating all of these Lego blocks that we have here
00:06:23,895-->00:06:26,445-->I don't think that should be too hard of a script to write
